The book is divided into four parts: The first part deals with the definition and characteristics of fantasy, the second part with the methods and techniques of creative thinking, the third part with the applications and domains of fantasy, and the fourth part with the evaluation and criticism of creative products. Munari also provides a bibliography of books and articles on creativity and related topics.
 
Fantasia is a classic work on creativity that has inspired generations of artists, designers, educators, and innovators. It is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn how to unleash their creative potential and enrich their lives with original and innovative solutions.

In addition to his work as a designer and artist, Munari was also a prolific writer and educator. He published more than 40 books on various topics, such as design theory, visual communication, art history, and children's literature. He also taught courses and workshops on creativity and design in Italy and abroad, collaborating with institutions such as Harvard University, MIT, the Triennale di Milano, and the Ulm School of Design. He received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to culture and education, such as the Compasso d'Oro (1954, 1955, 1979), the Japan Design Foundation Prize (1985), and the Andersen Prize for best children's author (1974).
 
Munari died in Milan in 1998, at the age of 90. His legacy lives on in his works, which are displayed in museums and collections around the world, such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. His books are still widely read and translated, and his methods and exercises are still used by teachers and students of design and creativity. Munari was a visionary who believed that art and design could improve the quality of life for everyone, and that everyone could be creative if they learned how to use their imagination.

Some of Munari's most notable works include his series of Macchine Inutili (Useless Machines), which were whimsical constructions of wires, paper, and other materials that moved with the wind or human interaction; his Libri Illeggibili (Unreadable Books), which were books made of various materials, shapes, and colors that challenged the conventional notion of reading; his Negative-Positive paintings, which were abstract compositions based on the contrast between black and white; his Xerografie Originali (Original Xerographies), which were experimental artworks created with a photocopier; and his Codice Ovvio (Obvious Code), which was a visual language based on geometric symbols.
 
Munari also created many works for children, such as books, toys, games, and educational materials. He believed that children were naturally creative and curious, and that adults should learn from them and preserve their spirit of playfulness. Some of his most famous children's books are Zoo (1939), Nella Nebbia di Milano (In the Fog of Milan, 1945), Nella Notte Buia (In the Dark Night, 1956), Le Forchette di Munari (Munari's Forks, 1968), and Il Gioco dei Quattro Cantoni (The Game of Four Corners, 1975). He also designed toys such as the Cubo di Munari (Munari's Cube, 1957), a set of wooden blocks with different shapes and colors; the Scatola di Colori (Box of Colors, 1964), a kit of colored papers and tools for making collages; and the Acone Biconbi (1961), a lamp that could be transformed into different shapes.
